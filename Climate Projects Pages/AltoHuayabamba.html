				<h1> <a id="top"> Alto Huayabamba, Peruvian Amazon Rainforest </a> </h1>
		
				<p> The Alto Huayabamba is a conservation project protecting a city sized area of high Andes forest, ranging from lush tropical cloud forests to barren moutain tops.  </p> 
				<p> The diversity of ecosystems in the projects region owe to the dramatic elevation change in the project. The land is ultimately owned by the Peruvian government with a 40 year concession granted to an NGO for the protection of biodiversity, education and scientific research. </p>

				<h1> Co-Benefits: </h1>
		
				<p> The project includes education and outreach to those living in the project's region, including job training and environmental awareness training to help improve local's ability to make a good living without needing to exploit the forest's resources.  </p>
				<p> The project exists in a transitional region between the Amazon rainforest and alpine tundra. Along this gradient exist ten different unique ecosystems with many endemic and endangered species protected by the project! </p>

				<h1> Monitoring: </h1>
				
				<p> The project has considerably more biomass than the surrounding region, however, this is not just a result of conservation but also because the project is surrounded by Alpine Tundra.  </p>
				<p> Regional biomass has stayed relatively constant. Within the project, climate models taken from satellite imagery show an upward trend in biomass growth as funding for the project has increased in recent years! </p>
