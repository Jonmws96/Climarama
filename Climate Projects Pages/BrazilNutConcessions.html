				<h1> <a id="top"> Brazil Nut Concessions, Peru </a> </h1>
		
				<p> The Brazil nut Concessions project is a conservation project in Peru established in 2010 that preserves forest in the Peruvian Amazon. It creates credits by protecting forest that would have otherwise been destroyed.  </p> 
				<p> The project is a community effort to avoid deforestation in some of Peru's most biodiverse rainforests and refocus the local economy towards the passive harvest of Brazil Nuts which can only be found in old-growth rainforest such as that protected in the project. </p>

				<h1> Co-Benefits: </h1>
		
				<p> The Brazil nut Concessions project is focused on promoting an economy based on intact rainforest rather than logging. It works directly with concessioner communities who are highly dependent on local ecosystems, but have few resources to protect the land. Before the project, the local community only performed subsistence Brazil nut collection and in some cases farming. </p>
				<p> This carbon project seeks to create more economic opportunities by preserving forest, enriching the local community and further enabling them to protect the forest. As part of the project, a new processing facility has been created to increase the value of harvested nuts to increase incomes alongside the sale of carbon credits (which is divided between the project developer/organizer and the individual landowners). </p>

				<h1> Monitoring: </h1>
				
				<p> We note no meaningful disturbance or biomass changes in the project. This is a positive sign for this conservation project as it indicates that there has been little natural or man-made disturbance (such as illegal logging) of the forest. </p>
				<p> Cutting down of the forest outside the project appears to be increasing, however this is occurring at a slower rate than anticipated, and is not reflected dramatically in the regional biomass level. </p>
