				<h1> <a id="top"> Jari Para, Brazillian Amazon Rainforest </a> </h1>
		
				<p> Jari Para is a forest conservation project. It reduces potential greenhouse gas emissions by protecting a swath of forest almost twice the size of luxembourg! </p> 
				<p> Without funding from everyone on Climarama along with other contributors the forest would have been destroyed. It is a Certified Redd+ project at the front lines of deforestation. </p>

				<h1> Co-Benefits: </h1>
		
				<p> This project is very biodiverse, providing shelter to more than 2,400 species (fauna and flora). It forms an ecological corridor with several conservation units in it's surroundings with a rich biodiversity, diverse plant formations and species of ecological & social importance. The area also plays an important socio-economic role in the region as it serves as a home for hundreds of rural families.  </p>
				<p> Through actions that encourage the responsible exploration of natural resources the project promotes conservation coupled with socio-economic development focusing on sustainable business practices to improve the well being of communities as a result of protecting rather than exploiting the rainforest. </p>

				<h1> Monitoring: </h1>
				
				<p> Some deforestation has been detected within the project since its inception, however this appears to be uncoordinated and due to small farm activity which is relatively minor for a project of this kind of scale. Over the past 5 years the project and regional biomass has declined due to increased deforestation in the area which makes the project even more important in protecting such an important part of the ecosystem. </p>
				<p> Given the current political changes in Brazil, projects such as these are experiencing incredible pressure. Remote sensing data is being provided to the project developer, however, challenges continue in this key battleground in the fight against climate change and bio-diversity loss. </p>
