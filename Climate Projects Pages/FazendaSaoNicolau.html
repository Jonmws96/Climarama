				<h1> <a id="top"> Fazenda Sao Nicolau, Brazillian Amazon Rainforest </a> </h1>
		
				<p> The Fazenda Sao Nicolao reforestation project takes place in Mato Grosso, Brazil, near the border of where the Amazon rainforest transitions towards a more seasonal, drier, Atlantic forest type. A large portion of the project area was deforested in the late 1980s and 90s for both cattle and coffee production. The project has pledged to replant an area of forest almost half the size of the island of Manhattan, while preserving an area of slightly degraded rain forest approximately three times that size! </p> 
				<p> The land is registered as a private property to ONF International, a French group focused on improving forest management. The project has managed to plant 54 different native species on this land with approximately 622 hectares of truly mixed-species plantings and the remaining hectares primarily dominated by one species (which varies). Planting began in 1999 and continued until 2003. In order to supply seeds for the project, a nursery was constructed within the project area and continues to operate to this day. </p>

				<h1> Co-Benefits: </h1>
		
				<p> The project offers a great number of ecological benefits primarily by planting a mix of indigenous species, which offers a great deal of ecological diversity. The protected portion of the project is reported to have a total of 392 bird species, 41 mammal species, 30 reptiles, and 25 amphibians. Weeds are treated by hand to prevent them from overwhelming the planted seedlings.  </p>
				<p> The project is also the site of intense scientific study and hosts one of the world's few carbon flux towers to measure CO2 gas exchange. This makes Fazenda Sao Nicolao a valuable scientific resource as well to help increase our understanding of carbon sequestration and CO2 exchange moving forward. Several scientific studies have been published using research coming from this project. </p>

				<h1> Monitoring: </h1>
				
				<p> The project exists in a region that was intensely deforested in the 80s and 90s as seen by dips in the historical biomass. More recently, we've seen the project show biomass growth at a higher rate compared to region likely due to the regrowth of tree seedlings from the past decades. </p>
				<p> We do note some challenges in the regrowth which has taken some time likely due to the ambitious nature of regrowing many native species at once, however the project continues to be successful and long term should continue to show more advanced regrowth. </p>
