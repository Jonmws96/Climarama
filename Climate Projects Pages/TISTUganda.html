				<h1> <a id="top"> TIST Uganda </a> </h1>
		
				<p> The TIST Uganda project is a reforestation project spanning much of Southwest Uganda working with small farm groups to reforest and plant trees in a heavily deforested landscape. The project itself consists of 1,563 small farm plots from 291 farmer groups with 1662  members. </p> 
				<p> Uganda is one of the most heavily deforested countries in the world, with a 2008 study predicting that there may be no forest remaining by 2050. The TIST project is an exception to that. </p>

				<h1> Co-Benefits: </h1>
		
				<p> This project appears to have had a significant impact on countless Ugandan communities. The number of people employed by the project is not directly quantified, but is certainly in the thousands (if not tens of thousands). The farmer participants are divided into smaller groups of farmers who are allowed to select which species to plant that would best benefit their group. As a result, 33 different tree species were planted in total, most of which are fruit trees. Of the 33, six are native, and at least another six are likely intended for timber production (or carbon sequestration). </p>
				<p> Pests are managed through a series of natural (and very labor intensive) techniques, rather than pesticides. The tree species planted provide a huge range of community benefits, food sources, medicinal sources, and timber. Additional co-benefits are numerous, but include considerable outreach and training programs, as well as technology integration into remote communities (for live reporting). </p>

				<h1> Monitoring: </h1>
				
				<p> The remote sensing record indicates near total success of these plantations, with biomass inside the project increasing dramatically in the past decade! A vary small percentage of project areas (< 5%) appear to either be mis-located or possibly dropped out of the program (which is expected in projects involving many small groups). The satellite data also drives home the scarcity of forested areas on the Ugandan landscape outside of a few small parks and other fruit plantations.  </p>
