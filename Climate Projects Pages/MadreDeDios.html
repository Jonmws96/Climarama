				<h1> <a id="top"> Madre de Dios, Peruvian Amazon Rainforest </a> </h1>
		
				<p> Located in Southeast Peru, this part of the amazon rainforest is in the Madre de Dios region. It's a certified conservation project protecting nearly 100,000 hectares of forest! </p> 
				<p> By committing to maintain forest CO2 stocks above the regional common practice, the project sequesters additional CO2 than would otherwise be stored in forest biomass. </p>

				<h1> Co-Benefits: </h1>
		
				<p> The Madre de Dios project is a habitat to countless threatened and endangered species whilst preserving some of Peru's most biodiverse forests. Rare trees are identified as protected by the project with reproduction encouraged. </p>
				<p> The project also includes outreach programs to educate local communities on the importance of the forest ecosystem and benefits or protecting old growth rainforest. Including provisions for additonal outreach to native communities and allowing some land use by locals. </p>

				<h1> Monitoring: </h1>
				
				<p> We note an overall increase in biomass on this project in recent years, possibly as it recovers from degradation prior to the project. Simultaneously, some harvesting is notable inside the project, as is permitted by the protocol used by the project. Regional biomass is lower than the project, and some signs of forest degradation are present outside the project's bounds. </p>
